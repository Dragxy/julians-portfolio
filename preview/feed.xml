                <p><strong>6 Weeks at Eurofunk: A Developer’s Journey in Collaboration and Growth</strong></p>
<p>This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to spend six weeks at <strong>Eurofunk</strong>, a leading company known for its innovative contributions to public safety systems and services. Joining their team of talented developers, I was immersed in a professional agile development environment where collaboration, learning, and problem-solving took center stage.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Day in the Life</strong></h3>
<p>At Eurofunk, every day started with a <strong>daily stand-up</strong>. These quick team meetings fostered open communication, allowing us to share progress, tackle blockers, and align on priorities. I was also part of <strong>sprint retrospectives</strong> and <strong>reviews</strong>, where we analyzed what went well, identified areas for improvement, and showcased our work. These agile practices not only enhanced team productivity but also helped me understand how large-scale projects are managed in a structured yet adaptable manner.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Project: Mapping Automation with Street Data</strong></h3>
<p>During my time at Eurofunk, I worked alongside other interns on a project that combined technical innovation and teamwork.</p>
<h4><strong>The Goal</strong></h4>
<p>Our task was to develop a solution that automated the process of scraping and modeling street map data for one of Eurofunk’s services. This involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering data from various online sources.</li>
<li>Processing and transforming it into a usable format.</li>
<li>Creating a scalable pipeline that integrated seamlessly into the company’s existing systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>The Process</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: Understanding the web scraping tools and APIs we needed for the project.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Collaborating with teammates to draft workflows and architecture for the data pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>: Writing and testing code while adhering to Eurofunk’s coding standards.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: Ensuring the automated process delivered accurate, structured data to the service.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>The Learning Curve</strong></h4>
<p>This project was both challenging and rewarding. I learned:</p>

<p><strong>Seamless Tiling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented chunk-based world generation to ensure infinite expansion as the player explored.</li>
<li>Used optimization techniques like object pooling to maintain performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual Feedback</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated pixel-art assets to represent the terrain and features.</li>
<li>Biomes were visually distinct, with unique vegetation, structures, and NPCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<li><strong>Game UI and Controls</strong>: Ensuring the game was intuitive and fun to play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaboration was key, and we often reviewed and integrated our work to ensure the final product was cohesive and polished.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>What I Learned</strong></h3>
<p>This project was a massive learning experience. I gained:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deep understanding of Perlin noise and procedural generation techniques.</li>
<li>Optimization strategies for performance in large, dynamic game worlds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Working in a team taught me to communicate effectively and balance individual contributions with collective goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creativity in Problem-Solving</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turning a complex system like procedural world generation into a functional and enjoyable game element required both logic and creativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Result</strong></h3>
<p>The final game was a hit among our peers and teachers. Players could wander through stunning biomes, interact with NPCs, and uncover hidden treasures. The seamless transitions between environments and the infinite exploration made the game feel expansive and alive.</p>

<p>The <em>Indie Games Area</em>, presented by FH Salzburg, attracted visitors interested in the creativity and innovation of independent developers. Thirty game creators showcased their projects, offering attendees a glimpse into the world of unique, off-the-beaten-path games.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the Gaming Zone, the Retro Area was a paradise for fans of classic games, featuring iconic titles, pinball machines, and vintage gaming consoles.</p>

<h3><strong>From Art to Action: Beyond Screens</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>Artist Alley</em> was the go-to place for fans of creative craftsmanship. Featuring hand-made artwork, posters, jewelry, and fan merchandise, this lively zone celebrated the artistic side of gaming culture. Next door, the Tabletop Area offered a cozy spot for strategy, board, and card game enthusiasts to try out new games or join tournaments.</p>
<p>For those seeking action, the <em>Action Area</em> delivered thrilling experiences. Visitors tested their skills on KTM minibikes, engaged in tactical matches of laser tag, or had fun in <em>Bubble Soccer</em>—bouncing around in giant inflatable balls. VR matches blurred the lines between virtual and real, adding an extra layer of excitement.</p>

<p>The 4th-grade students of the science-focused branch spent a week in Croatia.</p>
<p>On July 2, 2019, the two science classes, 4AR and 4BR, departed from St. Johann heading to Croatia. On Monday, students picked up their snorkeling gear and tried on their wetsuits for the first time to ensure a proper fit.</p>
<h3><strong>Day 1: Getting Started</strong></h3>
<p>Well-equipped, the two classes began their first project day separately on Tuesday.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>4AR:</strong><br>The class boarded a boat that took them to the uninhabited island of Plavnik after an hour’s journey. Upon arrival, they received an introduction to snorkeling before diving into the sea to explore marine life. Among the discoveries were starfish, sea cucumbers, and a variety of fish. In the afternoon, the group moved to a plateau, where they caught the native Apulian tarantula and found other creatures such as a praying mantis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4BR:</strong><br>This class spent their first day snorkeling in a bay. In the afternoon, they participated in a scavenger hunt, where they discovered, caught, and in some cases, even tasted various organisms. Each group presented their findings in detail to the rest of the class through small presentations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Day 2: Switching Programs</strong></h3>
<p>On Wednesday, the two classes swapped activities. The only difference was that the 4AR also had the opportunity to explore an abandoned hotel.</p>
<h3><strong>Day 3: A Shared Adventure</strong></h3>
<p>On Thursday, both classes traveled together to another bay for their final snorkeling session. In the afternoon, they focused on various activities, such as collecting waste to contribute to environmental conservation.</p>
<h3><strong>Evening and Departure</strong></h3>
<p>That evening, everyone went on a group trip to the town of Krk. On Friday, after breakfast, the students headed back to Austria.</p>
