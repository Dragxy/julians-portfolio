            "content_html": "<h3><strong>My Role: Procedural World Generation</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>The Challenge</strong></h4>\n<p>Creating a world that felt alive, varied, and endless was no small feat. The goal was to generate a procedurally infinite map that seamlessly combined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Topography</strong>: Mountains, valleys, and plateaus.</li>\n<li><strong>Biomes</strong>: Desert, forest, tundra, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Features</strong>: Lakes, rivers, and villages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>The Solution</strong></h4>\n<p>To achieve this, I implemented <strong>procedural generation</strong> using <strong>Perlin noise</strong> and additional algorithms for layering and refinement.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Noise Maps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used <strong>Perlin noise</strong> to generate foundational maps for <strong>elevation, humidity, and temperature</strong>.</li>\n<li>Combined these parameters to define biomes dynamically. For example:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High elevation + low temperature = snowy mountains.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Low elevation + high humidity = swamps.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>World Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added rivers and lakes by calculating water flow from higher elevations.</li>\n<li>Randomly placed villages in hospitable areas based on temperature and terrain accessibility.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seamless Tiling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented chunk-based world generation to ensure infinite expansion as the player explored.</li>\n<li>Used optimization techniques like object pooling to maintain performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Visual Feedback</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated pixel-art assets to represent the terrain and features.</li>\n<li>Biomes were visually distinct, with unique vegetation, structures, and NPCs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Team Contributions</strong></h3>\n<p>While I focused on procedural generation, my teammates worked on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combat and Crafting Systems</strong>: Adding weapons, enemies, and resource gathering.</li>\n<li><strong>Quest and NPC Design</strong>: Developing a narrative and interactions to keep players engaged.</li>\n<li><strong>Game UI and Controls</strong>: Ensuring the game was intuitive and fun to play.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Collaboration was key, and we often reviewed and integrated our work to ensure the final product was cohesive and polished.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>What I Learned</strong></h3>\n<p>This project was a massive learning experience. I gained:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technical Skills</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deep understanding of Perlin noise and procedural generation techniques.</li>\n<li>Optimization strategies for performance in large, dynamic game worlds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working in a team taught me to communicate effectively and balance individual contributions with collective goals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Creativity in Problem-Solving</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning a complex system like procedural world generation into a functional and enjoyable game element required both logic and creativity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>The Result</strong></h3>\n<p>The final game was a hit among our peers and teachers. Players could wander through stunning biomes, interact with NPCs, and uncover hidden treasures. The seamless transitions between environments and the infinite exploration made the game feel expansive and alive.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Reflections</strong></h3>\n<p>Looking back, I’m incredibly proud of what our team achieved. Creating an infinite world from scratch and watching players immerse themselves in it was an unforgettable experience. This project sparked my interest in game development and procedural systems, inspiring me to explore these areas further.</p>\n<p>Unity has always been a powerful tool, but this project showed me how much can be accomplished with teamwork, creativity, and a passion for the craft.<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.hacdias.com/img/2000/8b305803cdfd3b2ec898c2917c2a3b96e9595bead637d8619ed4769b711d5404.jpeg\" alt=\"Procedural Map Generation With Noise - Henrique Dias\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>",

On Monday, students picked up their snorkeling gear and tried on their wetsuits for the first time to ensure a proper fit.</p>\n<h3><strong>Day 1: Getting Started</strong></h3>\n<p>Well-equipped, the two classes began their first project day separately on Tuesday.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>4AR:</strong><br>The class boarded a boat that took them to the uninhabited island of Plavnik after an hour’s journey. Upon arrival, they received an introduction to snorkeling before diving into the sea to explore marine life. Among the discoveries were starfish, sea cucumbers, and a variety of fish. In the afternoon, the group moved to a plateau, where they caught the native Apulian tarantula and found other creatures such as a praying mantis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>4BR:</strong><br>This class spent their first day snorkeling in a bay. In the afternoon, they participated in a scavenger hunt, where they discovered, caught, and in some cases, even tasted various organisms. Each group presented their findings in detail to the rest of the class through small presentations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Day 2: Switching Programs</strong></h3>\n<p>On Wednesday, the two classes swapped activities. The only difference was that the 4AR also had the opportunity to explore an abandoned hotel.</p>\n<h3><strong>Day 3: A Shared Adventure</strong></h3>\n<p>On Thursday, both classes traveled together to another bay for their final snorkeling session. In the afternoon, they focused on various activities, such as collecting waste to contribute to environmental conservation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Evening and Departure</strong></h3>\n<p>That evening, everyone went on a group trip to the town of Krk. On Friday, after breakfast, the students headed back to Austria.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"d-flex flex-wrap flex-directoin-row flex-row gap-4 mt-5 mb-2\"><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://www.gym-stjohann.at/fileadmin/_processed_/8/0/csm_4ABR_Meeresbiologische_Woche_Kroatien_1_ee3c544eae.jpeg\" title=\"\" class=\"lightbox\" rel=\"lightbox[myImageSet]\"><figure class=\"img-fluid news-max-img\"><img  src=\"https://www.gym-stjohann.at/fileadmin/_processed_/8/0/csm_4ABR_Meeresbiologische_Woche_Kroatien_1_e4f5ee7d97.jpeg\" alt=\"News 4.
